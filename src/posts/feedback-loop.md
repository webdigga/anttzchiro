During the development phase, the site will be available for you to look at (but not reachable for anyone searching on Google). This enables me to provide you with a link so you can see progress.  At certain times I will ask you for a review to make sure I am heading on the right track or see if anything you think needs changing / adding.

At Seven Kings Web Design, we value your feedback immensely. Your insights help us ensure that we're meeting your needs and expectations. We've established this feedback loop to provide you with a seamless way to share your thoughts, suggestions, and concerns with us. Your feedback enables us to enhance our offerings and deliver an exceptional experience tailored to you.
