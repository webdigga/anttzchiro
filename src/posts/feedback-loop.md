The feedback phase is an integral part of the web design process, where I'll actively engage with you to refine and perfect your website. This phase ensures that every aspect of the website aligns with your vision and meets your expectations before the final launch. Through a collaborative approach, I'll gather your input, make necessary adjustments, and deliver a product that you are thoroughly satisfied with.

During the development phase, the site will be available for you to look at (but not reachable for anyone on via a search engine). This enables me to provide you with a link so you can see progress.  At certain times I will ask you for a review to make sure I am heading on the right track or see if anything you think needs changing / adding.

At Seven Kings Web Design, we value your feedback immensely. Your insights help us ensure that we're meeting your needs and expectations. We've established this feedback loop to provide you with a seamless way to share your thoughts, suggestions, and concerns with us. Your feedback enables us to enhance our offerings and deliver an exceptional experience tailored to you.

## **Steps in the feedback phase**
