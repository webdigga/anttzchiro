I'll get started with development based off of our previous consultation and design chats. I'm probably going to have many questions for you during this phase to make sure i'm heading in the right direction.

This phase can take a week, depending on the complexity of the site.  The simpler the design / content architechture, the quicker the development.

I'll utilise cutting-edge technologies and adhere to industry best practices to produce a functional user friendly solution.

The development phase is where your website's design comes to life. During this stage, I'll start the work to create a fully functional, responsive, and user-friendly website. This phase involves meticulous coding, rigorous testing, and seamless integration of all necessary features to ensure your website performs optimally across all devices and browsers.

## **Steps in the development phase**
