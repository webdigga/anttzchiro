I have around 25 years working as a Web Developer / Software Engineer.  I have worked for companies such as the Telegraph newspaper and DAZN (Perform group).

Having worked on many content driven websites over the years I decided that now was the time for me to become a freelance Web Developer and start using my experience to create micro-sites focussing on local businesses.

Fundamentally I want the website to load quickly.. This is good for the user and also good for Search Engine Optimisation (getting your site to the top of the search results).

I run a suite of performance tests to ensure that my high standards are being met during and after development has finished.

I charge a fee based on how big the project is, and a small retainer which helps me cover hosting and any other maintenance that needs to be done.

Contact me for a consulation meeting to discuss your requirements.
