The design phase is a crucial stage in the web design process. It is where ideas are transformed into visual representations that align with your brand identity and business goals. This phase involves several key steps, each designed to ensure that the final product not only meets but exceeds your expectations.

This is a chance for me to show you previous sites that I have built and for you to show me any sites you had in mind for what you expect from the look and feel.

Sites that I build will be driven from a content management system which you will have full control of.  I will just need to know up front what sort of content we are dealing with so I can shape the templates and pages.

Armed with insights gathered during the discovery phase, we'll explore various design elements, color schemes, and layout options to ensure that your website not only captures attention but also aligns seamlessly with your brand identity.

## Collaboration is key

The design phase is built on a foundation of collaboration, creativity, and precision. By choosing Seven Kings Web Design, you'll benefit from a client-centric approach, and designs that are not only visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly.
