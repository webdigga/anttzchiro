Upon launch, we'll provide comprehensive support to ensure a smooth transition and address any post-launch concerns.

Once we are both happy it's ready then it's time for go-live!

I will host the site for a fee (recurs annually) and you can choose to either use a domain you have already purchased or we can talk about which domain you would like and I can help get this setup for you.

After that the site should be available on your new domain and the SEO magic will start happening to make your site reachable by search engines.
