content: You are probably wondering why the name Anttz Family Chiropractic. Dr.
  Hannah's surname is Emmett, which in old English means 'Ant'. In addition to
  this her Great Great Grandmother used to say "There goes those pesky Emmett's"
  as the ants crossed the front door step. So that is how the Anttz Family
  Chiropractic got its name.
