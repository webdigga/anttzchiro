faqs:
  - question: Can I book a one off adjustment?
    answer: You can, but only if you've had an initial consultation first, within a certain time frame. This is because we need to do a thorough examination to see what's actually going on in your body and with your nervous system. We can not only listen to where you feel the symptoms are as that can be very misleading. This is to protect you so that we don't do anything to cause you more pain and or damage.
  - question: What is an initial Consultation?
    answer: Our initial consultation contains two appointments, day 1 and Day 2. Day 1 involves going through your history, followed by an in-depth digital posture picture, joint testing, muscle testing, balance testing and any other orthopaedic testing that may be required.
  - question: Why do I have to have an initial consultation?
    answer: First, it's important to know what is going on in your nervous system and body. Second, we need to understand why your symptoms are there and to see if Chiropractic and Anttz Family Chiropractic health are the right fit for you.
  - question: How often do I need a review?
    answer: We do a review around every 12th visit to measure improvements and to see if we need to adjust the schedule to get you the best results.
  - question: Will I be treated in a private room?
    answer: Chiropractors treat patients in many different settings, including private, group or multi- disciplinary clinics and practices. Here at Anttz Family Chiropractic we opt for an open-plan space where several practice members are treated at the same time.
  - question: Will the adjustment hurt?
    answer: Treatment is usually painless unless an area is swollen. If this is the case, your Chiropractor will alter the care that you receive. You may also hear a clicking or popping noise. This is perfectly normal and commonplace with Chiropractic treatment. It is just a gas bubble bursting. Some patients also report temporary aches and pains during and after care. Again, this is nothing to worry about and is perfectly normal. If you are uncomfortable with the techniques being used during your treatment, you should talk to your Chiropractor.
  - question: How do Chiropractic techniques differ?
    answer: There are many different Chiropractic techniques. Some Chiropractors perform joint manipulation using only their hands while others use various instruments. Additionally, some Chiropractors treat using quick but firm manipulation while others have a lighter touch. Chiropractic treatment is largely driven by the individual preferences of both the Chiropractor and the patient, but adjustment choices are made for clinical reasons. Dr Hannah is one of 35 practitioners in the UK that also practises Network Spinal.
