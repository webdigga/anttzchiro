There are many ways to help yourself on a daily basis when you have back or pelvic pain during pregnancy. I am going to share with you my top tips in this report, to enable you to have a happy, healthy, and comfortable pregnancy. Combining these tips into your daily life will also hopefully allow the birthing process to be less painful, shorter in length and easier overall.

1. ## Avoid Sitting for too Long

   Sitting for longer than 20 mins at a time puts a lot of pressure on the pelvis and muscles surrounding the lower back. It is important to stay active during pregnancy as it helps to keep your muscles and ligaments strong and support the growing baby bump. As the bump grows, your centre of gravity changes which makes your lower back muscles work harder. When you are sitting you put even more strain on those muscles. Other things to be aware of when you are sitting are NOT to cross your legs or tuck your legs underneath you on the sofa/chair, this puts your pelvis in an awkward position which will stress the muscles and ligaments of your lower back.

   Try sitting up straight allowing the chair/sofa to support your back, you could even use a pillow in the small of your back to encourage the natural lumbar curve. Make sure your feet are touching the floor and that your knees are below your hips, this again will put less strain on the lower back and pelvic muscles. If you struggle to sit due to pain then I would suggest lying on your left side with a pillow between your knees to keep you neutral. With both sitting and lying the main thing is not to stay in that position for too long. Movement will encourage healing, reduce inflammation and stop any weakness occurring in the pelvis and lower back.
2. ## Stop Wearing High Heels

   High heeled shoes are a big cause of lower back and pelvic pain whether you are pregnant or not. This is because it changes your centre of gravity and forces your body forward, adding a growing baby bump into the mix and that is going to make it even worse. The muscles in your spine will have to work so much harder to keep you upright and over time this will start to create problems.

   Shoes that are flat or have a slight heel on them are fine to wear. I always suggest to making sure that it is a full shoe with good support especially in the arch of your foot. Make sure you stand up straight with feet about hip width apart and don’t favour weight on one leg compared to the other. It is crucial in pregnancy to keep your pelvis balanced and neutral, this will allow the body to get into the correct 
   position for the birthday process.
3. ## Gentle Exercise

   As I’ve already explained, movement is very important. Walking daily can help reduce pain and keep your back strong. Start with shorter walks (15-20 mins) and build yourself up slowly to do more each day/week if you feel you can.

   Swimming is also great for pregnant women, firstly, its non-weight bearing so it won’t put too much strain on the muscles and joints in the lower back and pelvis and secondly, the weightlessness allows the baby to move freely and helps them to get in the correct position for birth. I would suggest doing front crawl over breast stroke, however if you struggle with front crawl then do breast stroke arms and keep your legs straight and kick from the hips. Just getting in the water and moving around will be very beneficial if you don’t feel up to swimming. You could even try a gentle aqua aerobics class.

   You can also find many local pregnancy yoga and Pilates classes. They will help to stretch the body and strengthen your core muscles which will take the pressure off your lower back and improve your posture. Yoga is especially good for your overall well-being. It will improve your sleep, relax your mind, and keep you strong and flexible.
4. ## Have Treatment with a Professional

   There are many manual therapies that can aid you during pregnancy. You don’t have to have pain to benefit from them either.

   Chiropractic Care helps to restore proper function in the spine and pelvis, which will in turn reduce inflammation and pain as well as relax the surrounding musculature. Most chiropractors will work with the pregnant women to create the best environment possible for the baby to grow and develop, this involves gentle specific adjustments and muscle and ligament releases to the lower back and pelvic area.
5. ## Sleep Support

   Getting a good night sleep during pregnancy can be a challenge especially if you are in pain and uncomfortable. A good night's sleep is crucial as this is when your body will do most of its healing. Side sleeping is optimal during pregnancy, this helps improve the blood flow not only to your own body but to the developing baby. Sleeping on your left side is the most beneficial, you can pop a pillow between your
   knees and keep your knees bent, this helps to take the stain off the pelvis and give you added support.

   Taking yourself to bed 10-15 mins earlier than normal to do some guided meditation will also allow you to relax and have better quality of sleep, meditation is also good for improving pain especially if you combine it with deep breathing techniques.

   It is also worth avoiding bright screens, food and stimulants 2-3 hours before you go to bed, keep your bedroom cool and dark and follow a consistent sleep schedule.
