1. ## Step One

   First off, thank you for being one of the few who wants to move from pain to progress and experience the extraordinary in their lives. Just by being curious enough to read this, you have taken the first step. I'm sharing this with you because I want you to experience more: more joy, more freedom, more love, more flexibility, more adaptability, more magic. To do that, we have to stop focusing on experiencing less: less pain, less sciatica, less back pain, less shoulder pain, less neck pain. That may not make a lot of sense yet, but it will. In this booklet, I'm going to teach you some of the keys that are vital to shifting your experience of your body and your life.

   > The first thing to realise about pain is that pain is an indicator that something must shift NOW

   Keeping everything exactly the same simply leads to continued or increased pain. Unfortunately, that's what many people do. They find ways to work around the pain so that they can keep everything the same. It is critical to understand that pain is meant to interrupt your life. It's intended to be a warning, to demand attention and to encourage change. Pain is a calling for more available energy, more resourcefulness, and a cry for a revolutionary action that will constructively reorganise the way that you're living. The presence of pain means that it is time for you to change the circumstances of your life, to change your actions and choices, to change your perception of your body, and the perception of the world around you. Pain demands that you shift your awareness. The worst thing that you can do in the presence of pain is to keep living life the same way. The longer that you wait to realise that and heed that calling, the more pain you will experience until it gets louder and louder because you didn't make a change when it was small.
2. ## Step Two

   So, now that we agree that pain is an invitation to change, let's examine what this is signalling in our bodies. Pain is associated with inefficient function, inefficient capacity, and inefficient available energy and resources to maintain the current experience of your life. If you see a light flashing on the dashboard of your car, you immediately seek to find out what is not functioning correctly. Your car takes you where you need to go and the notification system alerts you when there is an issue with the overall proper functioning of the vehicle. The same thing is true for your body. Even more so, in fact.

   Look at the function of your body. Understand that health is not how you feel but it's how you function. What areas can function better, can you improve, and what coordinates all of your function? The brain and nervous system coordinate all of the functions of your body. Re-organising higher demands and growth to move forward and joyfully navigate your life requires an improvement in function.

   The spine is a phenomenal place to start to improve function. Since the nervous system controls the overall function of your body, it needs to be functioning optimally. Often, a person's nerve system can become disorganised from the physical or emotional experience of their life. That can start a chemical, biological response that can impair function, and transfer that impaired function to other systems of the body through the neural network. A weak, uncoordinated nerve supply only becomes weaker over time; uncoordinated signals in your body can cause it to be more prone to injury, more prone to pain, less likely to recover from injury, and will basically hold you back from a joyful experience of life. It is important to have the functional capacity of the systems of your body assessed, just as you take your car in for tune-ups on a regular basis.
3. ## Step Three

   Hopefully, at this point, you're learning that health, wellness, joy, and living an extraordinary life is not just about being pain-free. You must first value and appreciate the pain for the messenger that it is, and rather than shoot the messenger, you must see where you can make changes. So, in creating change and moving from pain to progress, a person must first value that which they wish to change. With that in mind, let's try to understand and identify what type of pain you're having

   > Pain From Avoiding Suffering

   You may be experiencing pain as you try to avoid physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual suffering. Pain can manifest in the body when you try to avoid what you don't like or don't want to face. If this is the case for you, then you have to shift and put more energy into discovering ways to connect with that which you might want to avoid, be it with yourself or others. This pain is both a warning signal and a gift. You can discover and nurture an ability to release tension, as well as find value in what you're feeling. Additionally, you have to allow yourself a greater range of experiences in your life. If you're finding suffering in the same emotional experiences and same circumstances over and over, then there's going to be continued suffering if nothing changes. Energise yourself to get a different range of emotional circumstances and experiences. Invite laughter into your life. Invite tears into your life. Invite adventure into your life. Increase the range of your emotional experiences.

   > Pain From Not Being Able To Manage One's Experience

   Pain can manifest when we feel like we are not able to manage our life. If you feel like you're constantly overwhelmed, whether it be at work, caring for the kids, or relationships with family or friends, your pain could be connected to not being able to manage that experience. If that's the case, shift your focus toward a new procedure, a new way of structuring your life, a new way of living your life, and a new way of reorganising your choices.

   > Pain From Not Making Enough Progress, Or Not Making Progress Fast Enough

   You want your life to continue to move forward and you probably have a vision or goal for where you should be in your work life, your relationship life, where you should be with your kids, your school and education, or your income. Pain can manifest when you feel like you are not making progress fast enough toward these goals, and often it can feel like too much to bear on a mental, emotional, or spiritual level. These feelings can somaticize in the body and become one of the most significant types of pain. If this is the pain that's surfacing in your body, the key is to value and appreciate where you are. You are where you are because you need to be. You are where you are because it serves something in your life. You are where you are because there's some gift for you to receive at this current stage. Yes, a gift. There's a lesson, skill set, or experience that you must receive before you can move to the next level. Appreciating, becoming aware of, and valuing your current experience and optimising where you are in life rather than loathing it, not appreciating it, or wanting to run from it is the answer. Optimise the experience of your job, of your financial situation, of your family, of your schooling and make the most of it so that you enjoy where you are right now. Because until you are enjoying and thriving in your current situation, and experiencing freedom in it, the door will not be open to the next stage of growth or experience of life. Be aware of being at odds with your experience and shift that to make it optimal. Energise and optimise where you are, not for the sake of getting somewhere else, but really to enjoy and make the most of it. When you experience that, you'll notice the focus on the pain will lessen and doors will open.

   > Pain From Not Seeing, Sharing, And Accepting The Gifts of Ourselves And Others

   Your life is a gift and seeing it as anything less than that is painful on many levels. The secret to living is giving as my friend, Tony Robbins, says. If you don't give more, you won't receive more or experience more in your life. Gifts don't have to be elaborate. A gift could be that you make great sandwiches and you give them to your co-workers. A gift could be that you have great tastes in clothing and you help others constructively with that. A gift can be that you are an artist and want to paint to bring joy to others. A gift could be simply your presence and your smile that lights up the room. Sometimes people don't realise that their gifts are appreciated or that they are gifts at all, and often we don't receive other's gifts. We think of life as full of things we've got to do, rather than things we get to do. The people we have to go see and the places we have to go, rather than the people we get to see and the places we get to go. Not seeing our life as a gift can cause significant pain. If you want to experience less of what you don't want and more of what you do want, give more. Give from whatever resource you have of your life. It doesn't have to be financial; it can be simply giving more to your life.
4. ## Step 4

   > The next step is to decide what you want to move towards to replace the pain

   Our focus determines our awareness and experience of our life. So often, when we have pain, whether it be physical, mental, emotional or even spiritual, we focus on it incessantly, day in and day out. What you focus on, you get more of, and the more you focus on having less pain, the more it comes to the forefront of your attention. Paradoxically, if you spend your energy trying to find treatments to alleviate pain, the more pain you have to alleviate. Instead, I want you to decide what you want to move toward.

   Right now, take a pen and notepad, and write down what you want to enjoy in your life. Instead of focusing on having less pain, what do you want to have more of in your life? Maybe you want more freedom. Maybe you want to enjoy more time with your kids. Maybe you want to enjoy more time with your spouse or your friends. Maybe you want more/better sleep. Maybe you want to go for a hike. Maybe you simply want to be able to walk or sit comfortably. If you do not have something to switch your focus to, it will be hard to move away from pain.

   Where do you want your new focus to be? As we discussed in the first step, focusing on pain just leads to more pain, so it's time to create a new focus. What do you want to have in your experience of your life to replace the pain?
5. ## Step 5

   As you reflect on these types of pain, there's an important triad of physiology change to focus on: structure, behaviour, and perception.

   What is your primary way of making a change?

   Is it shifting the structure of your life? i.e., moving around the furniture in your house or changing the timing of when you go to the gym.

   Is it shifting your behaviour? i.e., not turning on the TV or breathing deeply instead of reaching for snacks.

   Or, is it shifting your perception? i.e., being more aware of the choices you're making and how you are living your life.
