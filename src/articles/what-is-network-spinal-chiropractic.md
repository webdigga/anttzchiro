## Introduction to Network Spinal (NS)

Network Spinal (NS) is a nervous system focused Chiropractic technique that works directly with the parasympathetic nervous system. This is why the main areas of contact are the sacrum and neck area.

If you are looking for a holistic approach involving Chiropractic, bodywork, and energy work, then Network Spinal (formerly known as Network Spinal Analysis or NSA) could be exactly what you're looking for. This unique modality uses a "whole" person approach, helping you to feel better in your body and therefore your life.

Network Spinal is a Chiropractic technique that is very gentle, organised, and specific. Instead of manual adjustments to the spine, which can involve "cracking" and "popping," Network Spinal utilises light touches to the spine, mostly in the neck and sacral (lower) regions. These light touches, known as contacts, help to unwind stored tension and trauma within the spine and nervous system.

## The Role of the Parasympathetic Nervous System

The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for the body’s rest and digest response when the body is relaxed, resting or feeding. What I also call the “relax, feel and have fun nervous system. This is basically the undoing of the sympathetic nervous system - the fight, flight, freeze or fawn part. 

## Holistic Assessment in Neurological Focused Chiropractic

Neurological focused Chiropractors are assessing the neuro-system holistically - bones, muscles, nerves, patterns, and how they interact with each other.

## Why Network Spinal is Unique and Gentle

NS being so unique and gentle is because we intervene at the level of the nerve. The specific areas where we contact is where the spinal cord is anchored. 

## Relieving Tension through Precise Contact Points

Accumulated stress and trauma causes the body to shift into the defense postures creating tension and patterns to form and build at these anchors. Each contact works to relieve the tension slowly over time and create a wave/flow like movement.

The assessment, we do not just place our hands on the body and contact points. We assess the nervous system, spine, muscles and connective tissue before and after each and every contact.

So on the table before each contact we assess: Defense postures, areas of tension, areas of breathing dysfunction, imbalances, pelvis dysfunction and adverse mechanical cord tension. Often the analysis takes longer than the actual contact. 

So, the contact points are very strategically and systematically with several perspectives/outcomes and lots of presence before we actually make any contact.

## Using Tools to Measure the State of the Nervous System

Some practitioners may also measure heart rate variability (HRV), surface electromyography, thermography, or other tools to check the state of the body and nervous system

## How Does Network Spinal Work?

NetworkSpinal is a gentle approach used by some chiropractors to assess and influence spinal movement and function, with the aim of promoting improved wellbeing.

This technique considers factors such as lifestyle stress and spinal tension patterns as part of a personalised care plan. Practitioners using NetworkSpinal focus on helping the spine move more freely, which may support a greater sense of ease and awareness in the body.

## What are the Benefits of Network Spinal?

This cutting-edge spinal care system physically eases discomfort, while simultaneously causing the body to develop internal, self-regulating mechanisms that allow it to better adapt to stress. The benefits of Network Spinal include:

* Improved physical state
* Spinal and joint realignment, leading to reduced pain and discomfort
* Improved physical state
* Development of a strong neural interface and central nervous system, resulting in increased neural efficiency and enhanced overall systemic function
* Development of an internal, self-regulating, self-correcting mechanism of self-healing that allows your body to adapt to stress and maintain a healthy, well-supported spinal and central nervous system
* Improved adaptability to stress
* Movement beyond chronic pain to a place of life advancement and enhancement as your health related quality of life continues to improve
* Reduced stress levels promote greater emotional well-being and quality of life
