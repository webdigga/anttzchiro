Living with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) can be challenging. From joint instability and pain to chronic fatigue, EDS affects many aspects of daily life. At Anttz Chiropractic, we offer gentle, individualised care designed to support people with EDS in feeling more stable, comfortable and confident in their bodies.

## What is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome?

Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a group of genetic connective tissue disorders. It affects how the body produces collagen - the protein that helps hold everything together, from skin and joints to internal organs.

For those with EDS, joints may be overly flexible or prone to dislocation. Skin can be soft and fragile, and day-to-day life may include chronic pain, fatigue or digestive issues. Every person’s experience is different, which is why personalised care is so important.

## How Chiropractic Can Help

Chiropractic care won’t “fix” EDS - but it can offer meaningful support.

At Anttz Chiropractic, we take a gentle, adaptable approach that respects the unique needs of people with EDS. Our care may help to:

* Reduce joint and muscle pain
* Ease muscle tension and spasm
* Support posture and body awareness
* Improve joint stability over time
* Support nervous system regulation

We avoid any high-force or uncomfortable techniques. Everything we do is tailored to your body and your comfort levels.

## Your Experience with Us

We understand that trust and safety matter - especially when you’re living with a complex condition like EDS. That’s why we always begin with a thorough consultation, where we take time to listen and learn about your health, history, and goals.

If we believe chiropractic care is appropriate for you, we’ll create a plan that works with - not against - your body. You’re always in control, and we’ll explain everything as we go.
