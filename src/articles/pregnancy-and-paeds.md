Do you think of pain as something that all pregnant women experience? Though it's common, it is not normal. There may be another choice than trying to cope as best you can with aches and pains. If your nervous system functions correctly, you won't have symptoms such as discomfort. Our pregnant clients report benefits such as:

* Better sleep
* Easier movement and mobility
* Higher energy levels

It's not only about mum, however-your baby has a greater opportunity to grow, develop and get into the right position for birth with chiropractic. How? If your pelvis is rotated, your uterus will twist, pulling on the baby. By aligning your pelvis and making sure there is no interference at the nervous system, you're allowing your child the best chance at great health.

## Studies Show Surprising Results

Recent research shows that the delivery times for mums under chiropractic care is shorter than for mums who were not under care during their pregnancy. There is also an indication that labour and birth are quicker and easier, with fewer interventions needed for chiropractic clients. When your body operates at its highest level, it can do incredible things!

## Comfortable Adjustments

We know that you may feel concerned about your comfort when you get adjusted. We provide pregnancy pillows and blocks to make sure that your adjustment is safe and easily tolerated. With our pregnancy pillows, you can lie on your stomach up to your last month of pregnancy, which most mums love to do.

We'll likely see you about once a month or every few weeks during your pregnancy. As your delivery date approaches, we may increase the frequency to weekly. It will, however, depend on your individual needs. For example, a mum expecting twins may experience more pressure in the pelvis and need to be adjusted more often. Some women like to get adjusted right around their due date because they feel it helps get their labour going.

## Our Individualised Approach

From day one, we want to know: what do you want to get out of care? We'll let you know what we think you can expect and what you can achieve with chiropractic. Some people want to feel more relaxed during pregnancy. Others want to continue to exercise until their baby arrives. We'll make personalised recommendations based on your goals.

## Paediatric Chiropractic

Chiropractic has the ability to make a difference in the lives of babies and children, just as it does in the lives of adults. It has been known to help issues regarding colic, nursing, sleep, digestive function, and so much more. Utilising gentle techniques provides comfortable care with an in-depth explanation to ease worry.

Sometimes, if the child is the only client, parents will begin to ask questions and often, as a result, seek chiropractic care for themselves. More often than not, it is a family affair.

## Helping Your Child Be Well

It's important to know that chiropractors do not treat any certain conditions. Instead, we make sure the nervous system is working at its best, which allows the body to be in a state of health. Most people,

however, seek our help because they're experiencing certain concerns. Some of the conditions we see most commonly in children include

* Developmental issues Eating problems Sleeping challenges Growing pains
* Sporting injuries
* Soft Techniques

Children are still growing. As such, they aren't adjusted like an adult would be. Our techniques for babies and children are extremely gentle. Often, no more than the pressure you'd use to touch your eyeball is required to start making changes. You might notice results quicker than you'd expected, too, since children respond rapidly to chiropractic.

In addition to chiropractic, we can advise you on dietary changes, developing healthy sleeping patterns and other lifestyle-related aspects that can add up to tremendous results for your child.
