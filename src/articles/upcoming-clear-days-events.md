**Next session to be confirmed**

### Week 1

**Discover** - Involves becoming aware of the breath, body sensations and patterns of tension or disconnection. It aims to cultivate mindfulness and develop a basic understanding of the mind-body connection.

### Week 2

**Transform** - Individuals learn specific exercises and breathwork techniques to facilitate the release of stored tension and energy. The focus is on connecting with different areas of the body, identifying patterns of holding or resistance, and allowing for transformation and increased self-awareness.

### Week 3

**Awaken** - Involves expanding consciousness and developing a greater understanding of the body’s innate wisdom and its relationship with the mind. Individuals may explore deeper emotional and energetic aspects, accessing inner resources and cultivating a sense of movement.

### Week 4

**Integration** - Bringing it all together, integrating the insights and changes experienced in the previous stages into daily life. It involves applying the principles and practices of SRI to support personal growth, enhance well-being and improve the overall quality of life.

***The cost for this webinar is £97***
