## Reusable Cotton face cloths

Have you ever gotten tired of using that horrible plastic like face paper on your tables, be it a chiropractic, osteopathy,  physiotherapy or massage table?

Well look no further...

The idea came about whilst I was at chiropractic school in the USA, the school I was at  had a sustainability certificate to show that it was reducing waste and as students we all had our own face cloth that we used in our hands on classes. In addition I noticed numerous chiropractic offices in the bay area using material face paper instead, their practice members either had their own face cloths that they brought each time to their appointment, or the office had a pile of face cloths and then afterwards the dirty one would go in the dirties bin and then washed, dried and ready for the next shift.

I decided to bring the idea back to the UK, to see if I could get more chiropractic offices going green and reducing their paper needs. The clients absolutely love them and in time it does save the clinic money. 

### What clinics are saying

> Absolutely fantastic idea, clients love them in fact they argue over them and we have reduced our waste down to one bag a week ~K Harm (Sensus Health)
>
> They are brilliant colourful and eye catching, wouldn't go back ~ Anon

If you are interested please [contact me for costs](/contact/), and colours, as we will tailor the face cloths to your individual requirements, but often the more colourful and flamboyant they are the more your practice members are going to argue over which face cloth they wish to use!
