## What is Network Spinal Chiropractic?

Network Spinal (NS) is a nervous system focused Chiropractic technique that works directly with the parasympathetic nervous system. This is why the main areas of contact are the sacrum and neck area.

The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for the body’s rest and digest response when the body is relaxed, resting or feeding. What I also call the “relax, feel and have fun nervous system. This is basically the undoing of the sympathetic nervous system - the fight, flight, freeze or fawn part. 

Neurological focused chiropractors are assessing the neuro-system holistically - bones, muscles, nerves, patterns, and how they interact with each other.

NS being so unique and gentle is because we intervene at the level of the nerve. The specific areas where we contact is where the spinal cord is anchored. 

Accumulated stress and trauma causes the body to shift into the defense postures creating tension and patterns to form and build at these anchors. Each contact works to relieve the tension slowly over time and create a wave/flow like movement.

### What you don't see....

The assessment, we do not just place our hands on the body and contact points. WE assess the nervous system, spine, muscles and connective tissue before and after each and every contact.

So on the table before each contact we assess: Defense postures, areas of tension, areas of breathing dysfunction, imbalances, pelvis dysfunction and adverse mechanical cord tension. Often the analysis takes longer than the actual contact. 

So, the contact points are very strategically and systematically with several perspectives/outcomes and lots of presence before we actually make any contact.

Some practitioners may also measure heart rate variability (HRV), surface electromyography, thermography, or other tools to check the state of the body and nervous system
