Chiropractors assess and address areas of the spine that may not be moving as they should, using evidence-informed approaches tailored to each patient.

While the chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex is an historical concept and remains a theoretical model, some chiropractors use it to describe changes in spinal joint function and their potential effects. However, there is no clinical research evidence that supports claims that vertebral subluxation causes disease.

## Subluxation and Chiropractic Treatment

Chiropractic care takes a different approach from traditional medical treatment. Rather than focusing on treating specific diseases or conditions, chiropractic aims to support the bodyâ€™s natural function by improving joint mobility and nervous system function.

Chiropractors use manual techniques, including spinal adjustments, to help restore movement in the spine and other joints. This approach is patient-centred and evidence-informed, focusing on overall wellbeing and functional improvement without the use of drugs or surgery.

## Chiropractic Care

**Our Chiropractors** focus on your nervous system. This system controls everything in the body. When there is no interference with the nervous system, your body is able to function at a higher level. Though most people come in for problems such as pain, we support your nervous system so that your symptoms may improve.

The benefits you can experience from Chiropractic include more energy, improved balance, better sleep, increased concentration and reduced stiffness, amongst others.

## Our Holistic Philosophy

There are three phases of care in our clinic. The first is called relief care, which is when we focus on relieving your pain. The next is stabilisation, which includes strengthening weakened areas of your body. The goal is to get you to the final phase called vitalistic care. During this stage, you'll come in for brief periodic checkups to help ensure your nervous system is functioning at its best.

## About

The third largest healthcare profession in the world, Chiropractic is a safe and effective affordable approach to treatment that utilises the body's innate ability to heal itself. A primary approach of Chiropractic care includes specific spinal adjustments that may affect the nervous system and contribute to improved overall health and performance.

Chiropractors may discuss potential contributing factors such as poor posture, injuries, or daily stress that might influence spinal joint function. However, claims that vertebral subluxations cause disease are not supported by clinical research.

Across the US and Canada, Chiropractors are commonly established in hospitals. Successful organisations such as Facebook and Google retain Chiropractors on staff for the benefit of their employees.

## Benefits

Chiropractors are university-trained primary healthcare professionals who specialise in the assessment and management of musculoskeletal conditions. Many people consult chiropractors for issues such as back pain, neck pain, and certain types of headaches that are known to respond to manual therapy. Chiropractors are also trained to identify when referral to another healthcare provider is appropriate.

Dr. DD Palmer began the Chiropractic profession in 1895 when he delivered the first Chiropractic adjustment to a man who had been deaf for 17 years after a back injury. The man's hearing was restored and Chiropractic was born.

How did correcting a man's back problem correct his hearing? To answer that question, let's take a brief look at how the body works.

Your body is a self-regulating, self-healing organism. These important functions are controlled by the brain and spinal cord via the body's intricate system of nerves. Your nerves keep a close check on every one of the millions of things going on both inside and outside your body every second of every day, without you ever having to give it even a moment's thought.

The skull protects the delicate tissues of the brain. The moving bones of the spine protect the vulnerable communication pathways of the spinal cord and nerve roots. When spinal bones are not functioning properly, this may affect the normal function of the nervous system.

Some chiropractors have historically referred to this as "vertebral subluxation."

A subluxation is sometimes described as a complex of joint changes that may influence nervous system integrity and general health. However, this concept remains a theoretical model and cannot be used to make claims of curing or causing disease.

Factors that may influence joint function include poor posture, bad sleeping habits, slips and falls, car accidents, strenuous exercise, work injuries, childhood falls, dehydration, and emotional stress.

Chiropractors are trained to assess and address joint dysfunction with the goal of improving mobility and reducing nervous system irritation. Chiropractic treatments, called spinal adjustments, are gentle, comfortable and highly effective. People of all ages can receive Chiropractic care to support better movement and overall function.

## What Is Subluxation?

Subluxation is a term used in chiropractic to describe changes in spinal joint movement or alignment that may affect nervous system function. While the medical definition of subluxation typically refers to a partial dislocation, the chiropractic perspective also considers the potential neurological implications of altered spinal mechanics.

As noted in regulatory guidance, the vertebral subluxation complex remains a theoretical model and should not be associated with claims of curing or causing disease.

## Subluxation: A Response to Stress

What may cause spinal bones to become misaligned or lose their normal function?

Chiropractors often consider three general types of stress that can influence spinal joint function:

**Physical stress** is the most easily understood. Whiplash injuries due to a car accident are common occurrences. The whipping action of the head can produce profound changes to the neck and its graceful forward curve.

**Chemical stress** in the form of drugs, alcohol, food preservatives and artificial ingredients can affect muscle tone and result in changes to proper spinal alignment.

**Emotional stress** such as anger, grief, fear and many others can cause supporting muscles to tighten, the spine to stiffen and postural changes to emerge.

This model offers a way to understand how stress can influence physical function. However, chiropractors must ensure that any claims made are evidence-informed and comply with regulatory standards.
