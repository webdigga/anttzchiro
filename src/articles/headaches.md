1. ## Enhance your Stance

   Have you ever thought your posture might be the leading cause of your headaches and migraines?! Your head is as heavy as a bowling ball, and if you are carrying that around on top of your shoulders in the WRONG way every day - imagine what that is going to do to all those muscles, joints, ligaments and nerves in that area?\
   Make sure when you are sitting or standing you relax your shoulders back and down, stretching your head to the top of the ceiling. Tuck your chin in slightly and see if you can get your ear lobe in line with the tip of your shoulder. To encourage this type of posture, try this exercise: tuck your chin into your neck, keeping it parallel with the floor, and make a double chin (fun exercise at work while others are watching!) - hold this for 5 seconds and repeat 10 times. That activates those postural muscles at the back of your neck, so they can do the right job properly again!
2. ## Check your Tech

   Did you know that technology is one of the principle causes of the modern-day posture epidemic? Hours spent in front of a computer, slouched on a couch, looking down at your iPad or iPhone - all of these contribute to increased stress on your neck, possibly leading to you headaches and migraines.\
   When using your phone or tablet, try bringing it up to eye level to reduce the force going through your neck. Make sure you are holding your phone to your ear correctly when making phone calls, and not bending your neck to the side to hold it there between your ear and shoulder - better yet, use a headset. And lastly, when using your computer screen up to eye level. You can do this by buying a laptop/computer lifter to adjust the screen or simply place some books underneath it.
3. ## Eat the Right Treat!

   Fasting, eating high sugary meals or processed foods, dieting or skipping meals can all contribute to a sudden drop or spike in your blood sugar levels. This in turn could be the leading causes of your headaches and migraines.\
   Eating small, regular meals that are prepared with natural (organic if possible) ingredients is the best way to keep your blood glucose in check. Avoid overly processed, packaged foods, as the ingredients in them lack the nutrients your body needs. Try replacing refined sugar for healthy alternatives, like organic honey or try maple syrup. And if you are craving a sweet treat, try reaching for some fresh fruit, or a date instead - sweet and sticky and the perfect substitute for those mid-afternoon cravings!
4. ## Drink Water for a Healthy Glow

   This is a common trigger for a lot of people suffering from headaches and migraines. Being dehydrated may not only come from NOT drinking enough water, but possibly drinking TOO much caffeine - think coffee, tea, energy drinks, chocolate! Cut down on these and increase your water intake, little bits often throughout the day - and your body will thank you for it in more ways than one!
5. ## Sleep Deep

   Did you know you spend one third of your life in bed!. Having the correct sleeping position is critical to good alignment of your spine. Not only this, but disturbed sleeping patterns and fatigue both can be a major trigger for headaches and migraines.\
   Sleeping in a natural and neutral position, maintaining the normal curve of your spine is paramount to good alignment. Sleeping on your stomach is the worst position for your spine - as this places your neck in an unnatural bend and increased stress on your lower back! Make sure your pillow supports the natural curve of your neck. Natural fill pillows might feel more comfortable to start, but lose their shape within 30 minutes to an hour! Try a memory foam pillow that allows your cervical spine to be in a relaxed position without too much bend.\
   If sleeping has always been troublesome for you, try these tips: lower the lights before bed and avoid looking at a screen (TV, laptop, phone) - this artificial light tricks the body into thinking it’s still day time, and so doesn’t “switch off”. Try some soothing music, or a bedtime meditation, as well as soothing smells (lavender is great!) and tea (chamomile!).
6. ## Get Less Bag Drag

   Humans are creatures of habit - so most of us, when carrying our bags or cases, are always carrying them over the same shoulder, creating repetitive stress to the neck and shoulder. Your back should not exceed more than 10% of your body weight. When it goes over this weight it places stresses and strain through your head, neck and shoulders- leading to pain and headaches.\
   Check the weight of your bag before leaving the house and remove any unnecessary items. When carrying a bag with short straps, sling it over your shoulder and tuck your purse under your arm close to your body. When carrying a bag with long straps, sling it over the opposite shoulder to help the shoulders relax. This way your shoulders won’t contract to prevent the bag from falling. Try and switch shoulders every so often to prevent repetitive strain.
7. ## Stress Less

   Stress is a crucial factor when it comes to headaches and migraines. In this day and age, we are all living fast paced and chaotic lives - but taking 10 mins out in your busy schedule can save you hours at the end of the day, especially if it is going to keep that headache away!\
   There are many meditations and mindfulness apps to download nowadays, from a 2 min guided meditations for the newbie’s, to an hour long for the more experiences. Many successful business people and athletes have found the benefit of mediation and mindfulness.
8. ## Done and Dusted - Now Get Adjusted!

   Now all you should do is go and see your local chiropractor for a check-up! Chiropractors look at the alignment of the spine to make sure your nervous system is functioning optimally. There is no better way than to get a hands-on chiropractic assessment to see what the underlying cause of those headaches is, and how to get rid of them.
