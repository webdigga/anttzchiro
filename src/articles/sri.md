Breathing exercises help calm down anxiety, keep us grounded, and recenter our souls. There is strength in breath! Somato Respiratory Integration, also known as SRI, is a powerful tool that you can use to recenter your heart, mind, and soul. SRI exercises are based on the 12 Stages of Healing, created by Dr. Donald Epstein. Donny discovered that people go through these 12 Stages throughout their journeys of healing and transformation. "stage" correlates with a specific SRI exercise, starting with Stage 1, which we call suffering, all the way to stage 12, which we call community.

Somato Respiratory Integration (SRI) is a set of breathing exercises that involves the breath and body. Soma, meaning body, and respiration, meaning breath. These SRI exercises allow you to connect with the natural rhythms of your body through energy, touch, and Movement.

## SRI Breathing Exercises

Holistic tools, like SRI breathing exercises, are irreplaceable at times when you need them! Have you ever been in so much emotional pain, and someone tells you to just get over it? That's the last thing you want to hear. Somato Respiratory Integration allows us to be ok with wherever we're at, without judgement. Only when we're able to work THROUGH that state, are we able to move forward.

## Somato Respiratory Integration (SRI)

SRI is grounded in Reorganisational Healing and to put it simply, it's a powerful series of exercises using breath, awareness, touch and movement developed to help you connect your body and mind, and deal with life more efficiently and positively.

Through working with thousands of patients over many decades, NetworkSpinalÂ® founder, Dr. Donald Epstein, noticed predictable patterns in the way people move and breathe when they experience both negative and positive life events.

## The Twelve Stages

He categorised a dozen unique rhythms, which he identified as **The Twelve Stages of Healing**. Collectively they make up the set of exercises called Somato Respiratory Integration.

* It's much harder to free yourself from tension by concentrating on an area of stress- it may actually increase the defence status of the body
* Instead we always start from an area of peace or ease, bringing its energy and memory to the area that is blocked or stressed or painful

**The first three stages** are helpful for those who are suffering physically, emotionally or mentally. We become aware of the rhythms and polarities of our suffering and also discover we are somehow involved in a process and are partially responsible for our recognising that it is associated with being stuck in a particular perspective.

**The next four stages** are associated with 'breaking through' and making significant life changes to conquer suffering. Ways to create change are discovered and resolution achieved.

**The last five stages** represent a more awakened consciousness. Having dealt with and resolved suffering, the individual is left with an enlightened and deeper sense of wellbeing. They are ready to participate in life in a more profound and satisfying way.
